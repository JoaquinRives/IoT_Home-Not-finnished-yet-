# IoT Home (Not finnished yet)
A project I am working on for home automation with a Raspberry Pi 3

App to control things at home from anywhere using a Raspberry pi 3 and Flask. On this project I am making use of different sensors to collect data and perform multiple tasks. I will also program the GPIOs of the RPi to control a 4 Channel Relay that can be connected to any appliances. 
The commands to the RPi will be sent using a simple webpage by creating a local Web server on the Raspberry Pi. I am using Python and Flask for this project.

=> Features:
  -	Temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure monitoring.
  -	Switch control of any electrical device or lights
  -	Alarm system with video recording, motion detection and automatic notification by email
  -	House heating control

=> Devices used for the project:
  -	Raspberry Pi 3 B with Raspbian OS
  -	4 Channel Relay (5V Active Low - Output AC 250V)
  -	Raspberry camera module 5MP 
  -	Sensor Hub:
    o	Temperature and Humidity
    o	Atmospheric Pressure
    o	Light Intensity Detection
    o	Motion Detection

=> Testing the App (Video)  #TODO

=> Pictures  #TODO
